	1. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

***********************************************************************

Intel Pentium 200 MMX PC (or 100% compatible CPU)
DirectX supported 3D Accelerator Card
DirectX v.6 (Included on Installation CD)
32Mb RAM (64Mb recommended)
64Mb free Hard Drive 
Windows 95


The ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR Demo is a work in-progress. Thus it is not
fully optimised and configured for lower spec machines. These issues
will be corrected for the full retail version, giving the end user
control over engine and special effect variables ensuring smooth
gameplay over a wide variety of CPUs, accelerator cards and RAM.

Due to the complexity of the ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR models, users with
32Mb of RAM may experience some memory paging, especially when exiting
the game and returning to Windows. These problems will be fixed for the
release version of the game.


KNOWN ISSUE WITH SOUNDBLASTER LIVE! CARDS:

Currently with SoundBlaster Live! cards, the EAX environmental
extensions are applied to all the audio being played from the CD. 
While this does not necessarily interfere with the game; to stop 
it from happening, follow these steps:

1. Access your Creative AudioHQ, usually found in

 Start Menu --> Programs --> Creative--> Soundblaster Live! --> AudioHQ

2. Access the 'Environmental Audio' control applet 

3. Click on the 'Options' tab within the Environmental Audio window.

4. Check the 'Always Save Changes Automatically' preference box.

5. Click the 'Source' tab.

6. Select the CD Digital source and set the Reverb & Chorus amounts
   to 0%. Leave the Original Sound source at 100%.

7. Do the same with the CD Audio source. (Reverb & Chorus at 0%)

8. Click on 'Close' and you will be prompted to input a name for your
   new settings. We suggest 'No CD effects' or similar.

9. You are now ready to play ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR with normal CD
   music. This issue should be resolved for the full release of the game.

	2. DEMO OBJECTIVES

***********************************************************************

As the Marine, you are the last surviving member of your squad. Your
mission was to explore and investigate the Atmosphere Processor, then
destroy it. You were to remain as guard inside the APC... until your
squad were brutally massacred by forces unknown. Your mission is now
to survive and follow the instructions beamed down to you from your
mission commander from his support ship in low orbit.


***********************************************************************

	3. INSTALLATION

***********************************************************************

ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR requires DirectX 6. This can be found within the 
game's installation directory and you will be prompted to install it if
it is not on your system when you install the Demo.

To install the ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR Demo, double click on Setup.exe
Follow the onscreen instructions.

ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR dynamically streams FMV from your machine's 
local hard-drive. This playback is greatly enhanced if the FMV files 
are installed on a defragmented directory. We STRONGLY recommend 
de-fragging your hard drive before installing ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR.

To de-fragment your drive, either use the Windows95 accessory
'Disk Defragmenter' or any other 3rd party defragmentation utility.

Although the ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR Demo will work with other 
applications running in the background, for the best results it is
recommended that you run the game as a stand-alone application 
(with no other applications running).

As well as avoiding possible conflicts from other applications, this 
will also help prevent Windows from accessing the hard drive Virtual 
Memory swap file, and affecting the speed and sound effects of the 
game.

	5. MARINE EQUIPMENT

***********************************************************************

HEALTH

Health is displayed as green numerals in the top right of your screen.
When you are damaged, your screen will flash red from the sides. Your
health can be replenished from healthpacks your comrades have dropped
in various levels of the Atmosphere Processor.


ARMOR

Armor protects you from both acid blood and other forms of damage. It
is displayed beneath the health numerals as a percentage. You may don
extra armor if you find it.


IMAGE INTENSIFIER

All Colonial Marines are equipped with image intensification optics.
Once activated your vision is augmented for low light conditions, thus
allowing you to see even in pitch darkness. You may use the Intensifier
at will, although it does temporarily burn-out if you are near a strong
light source (such as your weapon firing).


FLARES

You come equipped with small phosphorus flares that you may throw to
light your way. These will stick to any surface and provide a strong
yet temporary light, as well as a deal of smoke. Flares and your
Image Intensifier naturally do not mix well.


***********************************************************************

	6. MARINE WEAPONS

***********************************************************************

PULSERIFLE 	(slot 1)

A Colonial Marine's standard weapon, combining a powerful assault rifle
with an under and over grenade launcher. It carries 99 rounds in the 
magazine - watch for reloads! The number of grenades it can carry are
limited - look for your companion's old pulserifles for reloads.
The PulseRifle is less accurate if you are moving whilst firing.


SMARTGUN	(slot 2)

A mobile Colonial Marine's most powerful weapon, the SmartGun is a 
masterpiece of technology. Mounted on a gyroscopic harness, it literally
aims itself, targeting the centre of mass. It is linked to the marine's
Head Up Display - once it has acquired a target the recticle turns red
and begins to track. To fully use a SmartGun, the operator must watch
where the gun wishes to move and lead it manually - this drastically
decreases aiming time. Smartguns are less useful against smaller, more
agile targets. The smartgun is belt-fed from a large magazine mounted
on the harness, so rarely runs out of ammunition. Care should be taken
as the armour piercing bullets from the SmartGun will deal with most
targets in an explosive manner - short bursts will be sufficient to 
deal with almost any foe.


FLAMETHROWER	(Slot 3)

The Flamethrower is specifically designed as a close-combat weapon for
the clearing of areas. It is somewhat inaccurate, but the jet of napalm
will eventually kill anything it ignites. Keep the jet trained on a 
target to inflict more direct damage.
The flamethrower runs out of fuel in a very short space of time - short
controlled bursts are the most economical method of firing.

WARNING! The napalm fired from the flamethrower is dangerous - do NOT
run forwards whilst firing (walking is OK) else you will set yourself
on fire. Additionally, it is possible that the napalm will 'bounce' off
a surface and back onto the user. However, nothing is more effective
than the flamethrower when exterminating vermin.
