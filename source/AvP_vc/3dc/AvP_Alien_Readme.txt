	1. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

***********************************************************************

Intel Pentium 200 MMX PC (or 100% compatible CPU)
DirectX supported 3D Accelerator Card
DirectX v.6 (Included on Installation CD)
32Mb RAM (64Mb recommended)
64Mb free Hard Drive 
Windows 95


The ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR Demo is a work in-progress. Thus it is not
fully optimized and configured for lower spec machines. These issues
will be corrected for the full retail version, giving the end user
control over engine and special effect variables ensuring smooth
gameplay over a wide variety of CPUs, accelerator cards and RAM.

Due to the complexity of the ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR models, users with
32Mb of RAM may experience some memory paging, especially when exiting
the game and returning to Windows. These problems will be fixed for the
release version of the game.


KNOWN ISSUE WITH SOUNDBLASTER LIVE! CARDS:

Currently with SoundBlaster Live! cards, the EAX environmental
extensions are applied to all the audio being played from the CD. 
While this does not necessarily interfere with the game; to stop 
it from happening, follow these steps:

1. Access your Creative AudioHQ, usually found in

 Start Menu --> Programs --> Creative--> Soundblaster Live! --> AudioHQ

2. Access the 'Environmental Audio' control applet 

3. Click on the 'Options' tab within the Environmental Audio window.

4. Check the 'Always Save Changes Automatically' preference box.

5. Click the 'Source' tab.

6. Select the CD Digital source and set the Reverb & Chorus amounts
   to 0%. Leave the Original Sound source at 100%.

7. Do the same with the CD Audio source. (Reverb & Chorus at 0%)

8. Click on 'Close' and you will be prompted to input a name for your
   new settings. We suggest 'No CD effects' or similar.

9. You are now ready to play ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR with normal CD
   music. This issue should be resolved for the full release of the game.

	2. DEMO OBJECTIVES

***********************************************************************

Playing as an Alien, you start in an Atmosphere Processor secured
by Colonial Marines. You must escape to the planet's surface to alert
the Hive. You must proceed with speed and stealth, and use guile to
disable and destroy those forces which you cannot attack head-on.


***********************************************************************

	3. INSTALLATION

***********************************************************************

ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR requires DirectX 6. This can be found within the 
game's installation directory and you will be prompted to install it if
it is not on your system when you install the Demo.

To install the ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR Demo, double click on Setup.exe
Follow the onscreen instructions.

ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR dynamically streams FMV from your machine's 
local hard-drive. This playback is greatly enhanced if the FMV files 
are installed on a defragmented directory. We STRONGLY recommend 
de-fragging your hard drive before installing ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR.

To de-fragment your drive, either use the Windows95 accessory
'Disk Defragmenter' or any other 3rd party defragmentation utility.

Although the ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR Demo will work with other 
applications running in the background, for the best results it is
recommended that you run the game as a stand-alone application 
(with no other applications running).

As well as avoiding possible conflicts from other applications, this 
will also help prevent Windows from accessing the hard drive Virtual 
Memory swap file, and affecting the speed and sound effects of the 
game.

***********************************************************************

	5. ALIEN ABILITIES

***********************************************************************

HEALTH

Health is displayed as the numerals in the top right of your screen.
When you are damaged, your screen will flash yellow from the sides.
Your health can be replenished by feeding on other lifeforms - see
JAW ATTACK in the ALIEN WEAPONS section.

ARMOR

The strength of the Alien's exoskeleton is displayed as the numerals
directly under HEALTH. As with HEALTH, damage to the exoskeleton can
be repaired by feeding on other lifeforms.

VISION MODES

The Alien has the ability to 'see' the world through two modes: 
HUNTING and NAVIGATION. In HUNTING mode the Alien's senses are
attuned to searching for prey, whereas in NAVIGATION mode the
senses are concentrated on defining the surrounding environment.

MOVEMENT & CLIMBING

The Alien has the ability to move on any surface. Simply hold down
the 'Crouch/Climb' key whilst moving. When climbing, releasing the
key will release the Alien's grip and drop it to the floor. Using
the 'Jump' key while climbing will cause the Alien to pounce in the
direction it is looking.


***********************************************************************

	6. ALIEN WEAPONS

***********************************************************************

CLAWS

Tapping or holding the 'Claw Attack' button triggers a flurry of
swipes and slashes. In the right circumstances the 'Claw Attack'
button can also trigger the secondary jaws.

JAW

The secondary jaws can be used to feed on other lifeforms, thus
replenishing HEALTH and ARMOR. Jaw attacks require a certain amount
of skill to achieve. When a target's head is close enough and in the
centre of the screen (the 'sweet-spot') the Alien's inner jaws will
become visible to indicate that a jaw attack is possible. Pressing
the 'Claw Attack' key will then launch the jaw attack. 

N.B. Jaw attacking corpses provides less of a health/armor bonus than
live prey - assuming that the corpse still has a head. Try practicing
on unarmed personnel!

TAIL

Tapping 'Tail Attack' causes a quick, low power, jab, whereas holding
down the 'Tail Attack' button readies the tail for a more powerful
strike. The tail will automatically target any prey in front of the
Alien.
